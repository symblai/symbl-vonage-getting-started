# Symbl+Vonage - Getting Started

This repo contains a starting point for creating Symbl-enabled Vonage apps. These are just a few example starting point from an unending number of possible starting points. The idea of this repo is to get someone quickly trying and programming new integrations with hopes individuals move onto more interesting project configurations.

Advanced users of Symbl and Vonage who have other interesting starting points for developers looking to work on this type of integration are welcome to contribute back their project template to this repo!

## List of Starting Points

### [standalone-device](https://github.com/symblai/symbl-vonage-getting-started/blob/main/standalone-device)

Use the [standalone-device](https://github.com/symblai/symbl-vonage-getting-started/blob/main/standalone-device) project as a starting point when you want to do everything on a single self-contained laptop. You can use this project simulate multiple users, but using a single device and single video call.

### [multiple-devices](https://github.com/symblai/symbl-vonage-getting-started/blob/main/multiple-devices)

Use the [multiple-devices](https://github.com/symblai/symbl-vonage-getting-started/blob/main/multiple-devices) project as a starting point when you want to do either:
 
- Run a video conference session **where everyone is on the same network** using multiple devices/laptops logging into a single video call
- Run a video conference session **where this app is deployed to a publically accessible cloud** and users will be using multiple devices/laptops logging into a single video call
